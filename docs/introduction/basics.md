# üìñ Tome's basics

## üìù Basic concepts

- **Tome**: It is the collection of **scripts** that have a common **origin** (a folder, a git repository, ...).
- **Origin**: site where a **tome** comes from, it can be a git repository, a local folder or a zip file for example.
- **Namespace**: is the name of a **tome**, it is used to group **commands** and to be able to simply differentiate in a simple way two **commands** with the same name. For example `foo:hello` and `bar:hello`, in this case `foo` and `bar` would be two **namespaces** that both have a `hello` **command**.
- **Command**: `@tome_command`
- **Script**: All files inside a `Tome`
- **Vault**: Local secure storage space for all those variables used in a **tome** that you don't want to expose. An authentication token or an encryption key are an example of things you might want to store in a tome vault.

    tome install <source> --create-env              # Create a new virtual environment, if the command depends on any requirements.
    tome install <source> --force-requirements      # If the origin contains a python requirements file, install those requirements even if not running tome in a virtual environment.

    tome vault delete -n <vault_name> -p <vault_password>                                       # Delete a vault with a password without password prompt request
    tome vault add-secret <secret_name> <secret_text> -vn <vault_name> -p <vault_password>      # Add a new secret 
    tome vault add-secret <secret_name> <secret_text> -u                                        # Add a new secret or update if exists
    tome vault add-secret <secret_name> <secret_text> --descriptopn <secret_descriptopn>        # Add a new secret with a description
    tome vault delete-secret <secret_name> -vn <vault_name> -p <vault_password>                 # Delete a secret
    tome vault list-secrets                                                                     # List available secrets id's and descriptions in all vaults
