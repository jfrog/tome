## Getting Started

Install `tome` using pip:

```bash
$ pip install tome
```

We highly recommend to [install into a virtual environment](./install.md).

## Using tome

### Installing scripts

You can install scripts from various sources like a git repository, local file or folder,
zip file (local or http), or requirements file.

For example, you can install the examples from the **tome** repository by doing:

```bash
$ tome install https://github.com/jfrog/tome.git --folder=examples
```

!!! note

    Use the ``--folder`` argument when you have your scripts under a subfolder instead the root of the repository


### Listing Available Scripts

To list all installed scripts:

```bash
$ tome list

🚀 ci commands
 ci:check-pipeline-status       Check the status of a pipeline in the CI.
 ci:view-logs                   View build or deploy logs from the CI system.

☸️  k8s commands
 k8s:deploy                     Deploy a Kubernetes resource using a manifest.
 k8s:get-pods                   List all running pods in a Kubernetes cluster.

📡 server commands
 server:check-health            Perform a health check on a server.
 server:log-watch               Stream live logs from a server.
 server:restart                 Restart a specific server instance.
 server:scale-down              Decrease the number of server instances.
 server:scale-up                Increase the number of server instances.
```

### Running a Script

Execute a script invoking it with ``<namespace>:<command>`` like:

```bash
$ tome ci:check-pipeline-status --pipeline-id 427

## Creating and Managing Scripts

### Creating a New Script

Create a new script with a predefined structure as a starting point using:

```bash
$ tome new <namespace>:<command>
```

Example:

```bash
$ tome new greetings:hello
```

To start using it, you can install this tome command as editable so that you can see the
changes while you are developing.

```bash
$ tome install . -e
```

The command will appear marked as editable: ``(e)`` if you do a ``tome list``:

```bash
$ tome list

...
🌲 greetings commands
 greetings:hello (e)            Description of the command.
...

```

You can open the ``./greetings/hello.py`` file with the editor of your choice and start
making changes. The changes will be inmediately applied when you are doing them because we
have installed it as [editable](./editables.md).

This command will create something simillar to this file structure:

```bash
.
└── greetings
    ├── hello.py
    └── tests
        └── test_hello.py
```

Let's check the ``hello.py`` file:

```python
import os

from tome.command import tome_command
from tome.api.output import TomeOutput

def format_message_hello(message):
    """
    Add exclamations for a message
    """
    return message + "!!!"


@tome_command()
def hello(tome_api, parser, *args):
    """
    Description of the command.
    """
    parser.add_argument('positional_argument', help="Placeholder for a positional argument")
    parser.add_argument('--optional-argument', help="Placeholder for an optional argument")
    args = parser.parse_args(*args)

    # Add your command implementation here
    tome_output = TomeOutput()
    tome_output.info(format_message_hello(f"Tome command called with positional argument: {args.positional_argument}"))
    if args.optional_argument:
       tome_output.info(format_message_hello(f"Tome command called with optional argument: {args.optional_argument}"))
```

For more details on the tome commands syntax please check [reference section](./reference.md).

## Testing Scripts

Tome supports testing using the ``tome test`` command. If you check the files that tome
new created you will see a tests folder with a ``test_hello.py`` file inside. To run those
tests just run:

```bash
$ tome test greetings:hello
```

To run tests over all installed commands:

```bash
$ tome test *
```

!!! note

    ``tome test`` command uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) under the hood, please install it by doing ``pip install pytest``

For more information about testing your scripts with tome please check the [testing commands](./testing.md) section.
